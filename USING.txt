If you're having trouble reading this file or "nisprog.ini" (no newlines, etc) :
open with another text editor (wordpad or whatever; notepad can't deal with this usually)

I'm not going to write a nice manual for this, sorry.
If you don't pay attention you can brick your ECU !

The core commands (set, debug, etc) are from freediag's code base;
refer to its manual for more info : http://freediag.sourceforge.net/Scantool-Manual.html

**** getting help inside nisprog
In nisprog, you can do either
"help <whatever_command>"
or
"commandname ?" to get descriptions and help etc. I think most of it should be pretty self-explanatory.

**** command availability vs npkern
The main idea is that some commands only work if the ECU is running npkern (see github.com/fenugrec/npkern ) :
		flverif
		flblock
		flrom
OTOH, "dumpmem" always works, but is way way faster with npkern running.

For that, you'll need an npkern kernel (compiled of course, maybe npkern_7058.bin ). See "runkernel" command

**** If you get in trouble (weird errors, etc)
"debug l1 0x8c" will start showing all sent/received data which helps for tracking issues.
Just do "debug l1 0" to silence the extra output.

try adjusting timing, etc. (see parameters for "npconf" command)

If you want me to help, I'll need
		full console output (previous commands, all errors etc)
		nisprog version
		OS, K line hardware / drivers, etc.

filing issues on GitHub is ok. Or you can post on the RomRaider forums.


**** special "submenu" commands
some commands (like "set", "debug", etc) also act as submenus, i.e.
######
set
interface dumb
port asdfasdf
up
## does the same thing as
set interface dumb
set port asdfasdf
######



Here are some example commands.
Note, these may become invalid as I work on nisprog and forget to update.

#######################################

set
interface dumb
port \\.\COM19
dumbopts 0x48

#sorry, you still need these
l2protocol iso14230
initmode fast
testerid 0xfc
destaddr 0x10
addrtype phys
up

#connect to ECU
nc

#optional, if your ECUID needs special keys (let me know if this happens !)
#setkeys 0x55552727 0xAAAA3636

#or even better, try to guess keys by reading ECU RAM:
#gk

#try "setdev ?" to see choices, i.e. 7055 / 7058
setdev 1

#some extra parameters if you're having timing issues (frequent read timeouts etc)
#try "npconf ?" to see list.
#Setting P3 to 0 usually works well and makes comms faster.
npconf p3 0

#if you're having read/write errors and playing with some npconf parameters doesn't help:
#try changing the kernel comms speed. By default this is 62500bps.
#kspeed 31250

#Run Kernel. Note, spaces in filenames will not work !
runkernel D:\dev\nis_kernels\npkern\npkern.bin

#dump command, uses regular fastdump or npkern fastdump if available. Syntax is "dumpmem <file> <start> <len>"
#Yes, dumpmem works on RAM addresses.
#Yes, dumpmeme works with EEPROM addresses, with some caveats. see "help dm".

dumpmem asdf.bin 0 256
#shorthand , same thing:
dm asdf.bin 0 256

#find differences between ECU contents and specified file.
flverif patched_rom.bin


#reflash !
flrom whatever_rom.bin
#nisprog will offer a few choices for reflashing; it can selectively reflash only the modified blocks.
# i.e. a 7058 ROM is 1MB, but the 16 blocks are split non-uniformly.
# ( they're called "erase blocks" in the ROM chapter of the datasheet )
# for example block 15 (0x0F) starts at offset 0x000E0000 in the ROM, and is 128kB in length.

# It is normal for a flrom "dry run" to report verification errors, since it does NOT modify the ECU.

#timing errors ? add some delays with "npconf" and try again.
#Don't panic, and DO NOT POWER OFF THE ECU if you suspect there were flash errors !

#all done ? are you sure ? then reset the ECU to leave kernel mode. Note, this has the same effect
#as power cycling the ECU / cutting all power to it, so DTCs and self-learn values are lost, etc.
stopkernel

#and disconnect / quit
npdisc
quit


#your laptop or nisprog crashed, or you quit before stopping the kernel ?
#No problem. Restart nisprog;
#do your usual
set
interface dumb
port blablabla
etc

#with one difference : kernel is running comms at a different speed, so
set speed 62500
#connect should work pretty solid
nc
#and set kernel speed + init the already-running kernel :
kspeed 62500
#initk (optional)

#continue where you left off !
