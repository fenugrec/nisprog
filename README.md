# nisprog

Finally, an open-source solution to work on and modify Nissan ECUs !

TLDR; go read USING.txt

(note : if you're looking for the command-line utilities previously found in this "nisprog" repo,
they've [been moved to nissutils](https://github.com/fenugrec/nissutils) . Sorry for any inconvenience.
